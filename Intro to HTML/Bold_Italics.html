    <h1>BOLD and ITALICS</h1>
    <h2>Italics: Emphasis vs. Titles</h2>
            <p>This is an emphasis italic: I <i>love</i> going to the beach!</p>
            <p>This is a visual-only italic: I finished watching <em>The Last of Us</em> last month.</p>
    <h2>Bold: Emphasis vs. Marker</h2>
        <p>Part of this text is <strong>very</strong> important!</p>
        <p>I bought a car the other day. It is a <b>newer car; a red Honda with a grey interior</b>. This is not important, but I wanted you to note that.</p>
