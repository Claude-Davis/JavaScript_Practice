//JavaScript uses dynamic typing; it does not necesitate the user to declare a variable's type
let num = 78;
let word = "Hello World";
let validity = true;

// the variables' values are flexible; they can be reassigned
let variableName = 50;
variableName = "fifty";
    //this does not cause an error
